--> Install Java (JDK) 21 LTS
    > java --version 
    > java -version (older)

    > javac

--> Install VS CODE (IDE)
    > Easy Code Management

--> We need class with body to begin with java program
    -> main method is must for running any java program

    -> Syntax:
        public static void main(String[] args) {

        }

        -> public - access specifier
        -> static - keyword for indicating no need of OBJECT
        -> void - keyword for indicating no retrun value
        -> main - method name
        -> (String[] args) - method argument 
        -> { } - method body

--> Order of Working:
    -> Write: Write the Java Program using JDK
    -> Compile: Compile the Java Program using JDK(javac)
    -> Run: Using JVM (part of JRE), run the byte code.
