4th June
==========

--> Install Java (JDK) 21 LTS
    > java --version 
    > java -version (older)

    > javac

--> Install VS CODE (IDE)
    > Easy Code Management

--> We need class with body to begin with java program
    -> main method is must for running any java program

    -> Syntax:
        public static void main(String[] args) {

        }

        -> public - access specifier
        -> static - keyword for indicating no need of OBJECT
        -> void - keyword for indicating no retrun value
        -> main - method name
        -> (String[] args) - method argument 
        -> { } - method body

--> Order of Working:
    -> Write: Write the Java Program using JDK
    -> Compile: Compile the Java Program using JDK(javac)
    -> Run: Using JVM (part of JRE), run the byte code.

6th June
========

    --> Variables

        -> Variables are names of memory locations
        -> Variables are used to store Data
        -> Variables will be processed(read/update/delete) using programs

    -> Variables Syntax
        -> datatype variable_Name = value;

    --> Data Types

        -> Data Types define the Type of data and size for the data.

        -> Data Types Classification
            -> Primitive Data Types
            -> Non-Primitive Data Types (Reference Data Types)

        -> Primitive Data Types
            -> We Have 8 Primitive Data Types

                1: byte
                2: short
                3: int
                4: long
                5: float
                6: double
                7: char
                8: boolean

    
9th June
========

    -> Declaration & Initialization

        -> Declaration: Creat  ion of variable with datatype
            -> int number;

        -> Initialization: Assigning a value to variable
            -> number = 10;

        -> Previous Session
            -> int number = 10; // Declaration & Initialization


    -> Concatenation

        -> Comibining two or more strings together
        -> Comibining other datatypes with strings

        -> Concatenation Operator (+)
            -> Strings
        -> Arithmetic Operator (+) 
            -> numeric operands


    -> Type Conversion & Type Casting

        -> Type Conversion: Converting one datatype to another datatype AUTOMATICALLY by java compiler

            -> NO DATA LOSS --> Type Conversion is considered SAFE

            -> SMALL To BIG (WIDENING)

            -> Handled by Java Compiler

        -> Type Casting: Converting one datatype to another datatype MANUALLY/EXPLICITLY by developer    

            -> DATA LOSS MIGHT OCCUR --> Type Casting is considered NOT SAFE

            -> BIG To SMALL (NARROWING)

            -> Handled by developer
                -> specify the data type (parantheses/datatype)

11th June
========

    -> Operators In Java

        -> What is it ?

            -> Special Symbols that would perform operations/calculations on Variables & Values

        -> Why we need it ?

            -> Perform calculations like Arithmetic, Logical, Comparisions etc

        -> Types Of Operators

            -> Arithmetic + - * / %
            -> Increment / Decrement ++ / --
                -> pre-increment / Decrement
                -> post-increment / Decrement
            -> Assignment 
            -> Comparision / Relational    
            -> Logical 
            -> Bitwise
