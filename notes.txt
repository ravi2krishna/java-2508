4th June
==========

--> Install Java (JDK) 21 LTS
    > java --version 
    > java -version (older)

    > javac

--> Install VS CODE (IDE)
    > Easy Code Management

--> We need class with body to begin with java program
    -> main method is must for running any java program

    -> Syntax:
        public static void main(String[] args) {

        }

        -> public - access specifier
        -> static - keyword for indicating no need of OBJECT
        -> void - keyword for indicating no retrun value
        -> main - method name
        -> (String[] args) - method argument 
        -> { } - method body

--> Order of Working:
    -> Write: Write the Java Program using JDK
    -> Compile: Compile the Java Program using JDK(javac)
    -> Run: Using JVM (part of JRE), run the byte code.

6th June
========

    --> Variables

        -> Variables are names of memory locations
        -> Variables are used to store Data
        -> Variables will be processed(read/update/delete) using programs

    -> Variables Syntax
        -> datatype variable_Name = value;

    --> Data Types

        -> Data Types define the Type of data and size for the data.

        -> Data Types Classification
            -> Primitive Data Types
            -> Non-Primitive Data Types (Reference Data Types)

        -> Primitive Data Types
            -> We Have 8 Primitive Data Types

                1: byte
                2: short
                3: int
                4: long
                5: float
                6: double
                7: char
                8: boolean

    
9th June
========

    -> Declaration & Initialization

        -> Declaration: Creat  ion of variable with datatype
            -> int number;

        -> Initialization: Assigning a value to variable
            -> number = 10;

        -> Previous Session
            -> int number = 10; // Declaration & Initialization


    -> Concatenation

        -> Comibining two or more strings together
        -> Comibining other datatypes with strings

        -> Concatenation Operator (+)
            -> Strings
        -> Arithmetic Operator (+) 
            -> numeric operands


    -> Type Conversion & Type Casting

        -> Type Conversion: Converting one datatype to another datatype AUTOMATICALLY by java compiler

            -> NO DATA LOSS --> Type Conversion is considered SAFE

            -> SMALL To BIG (WIDENING)

            -> Handled by Java Compiler

        -> Type Casting: Converting one datatype to another datatype MANUALLY/EXPLICITLY by developer    

            -> DATA LOSS MIGHT OCCUR --> Type Casting is considered NOT SAFE

            -> BIG To SMALL (NARROWING)

            -> Handled by developer
                -> specify the data type (parantheses/datatype)

11th June
========

    -> Operators In Java

        -> What is it ?

            -> Special Symbols that would perform operations/calculations on Variables & Values

        -> Why we need it ?

            -> Perform calculations like Arithmetic, Logical, Comparisions etc

        -> Types Of Operators

            -> Arithmetic + - * / %
            -> Increment / Decrement ++ / --
                -> pre-increment / Decrement
                -> post-increment / Decrement
            -> Assignment 
                -> a + 5 = a 
                -> a += 5 (concise form)
                -> Arithmetic + - * / % (applicable)
                -> = 
                -> +=
                -> -=
                -> *=
                -> /=
                -> == (equality)
            -> Comparision / Relational
                -> == 
                -> !=     
                -> >
                -> <
                -> >=
                -> <=
            -> Logical (combine multiple conditions) 
                -> && (AND)
                -> || (OR)
                -> !  (NOT)
            -> Bitwise (Binary Bits Cal)
                -> & (AND) -> Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
                -> | (OR)  -> Sets each bit to 1 if one of bits is 1
                -> ^ (XOR) -> Sets each bit to 1 if only one of the bits is 1
                -> ~ (NOT) -> Inverts all the bits 
                -> << (LEFT SHIFT) --> shifts the bits to left, filling with zeros 
                -> >> (RIGHT SHIFT) --> shifts the bits to right, preserving the bits 

13th June
==========

    -> Control Statements 

        -> Control Statements are used for CONTROLLING THE FLOW OF EXECUTION

        -> We have three categories of Control Statements

            1 - Decision Making Statements (Conditional)
            2 - Looping Statements (Iteration)
            3 - Branching Statements (Jump)

        -> Decision Making Statements / Conditionals
            1 - if Statement --> Check only one condition
            2 - if else Statement --> Check Two conditions   
            3 - Nested else if Statement --> Check Multiple conditions(more than two)      
            4 - Switch Statement --> Check Multiple conditions(more than two)      
            5 - Ternary Operator(concise form of if-else) 

        -> Looping Statements (Iteration)
            1 - for loop    
            2 - while loop
            3 - do-while loop

        ->  Branching Statements (Jump)
            1 - break -> come out of loop
            2 - continue -> skip the loop at current condition/Iteration
            3 - return -> exits from method, returns a value


        -> if Syntax
            
            if(condition) {
                Statements
            }

         -> if-else Syntax
            
            if(condition) {
                Statements
            } else {
                Statements
            } 

        -> Ternary Operator Syntax
           variable = (condition) ? value_if_true:value_if_false;       

        -> nested else if (else if ladder)
            if(condition) {
                Statements
            } else if {
                Statements
            } else if {
                Statements
            } .
              .
              .  
            else {

            }

        -> switch Statement 
           switch(expression) {
            case value1:
            Statements
            break;

            case value2:
            Statements
            break;

            .
            .
            .

            default:
            Statements
            break;

           }

        -> switch fall through condition

        -> new switch
            -> : Arrow Operator (Later can be used in Lambda Expressions)


16th June - LOOPS
=================

    -> Loop : Loops are used to EXECUTE block of CODE --> REPEATEDLY --> Based On CONDITITON

        -> When to use Loops: To Perform/Automate REPETITIVE TASKS

    -> Types Of Loops

        -> For Loop

            -> Ideal for situations, where you already know in ADVANCE, how many times you
                want to do a task.

            -> for (Initialization, condition, increment/Decrement)  {
                    // Statements
                }   

        -> While Loop

            -> Ideal for situations, where you don't know in ADVANCE, how many times you
                want to do a task.

            -> while (condition) {
                Initialization
                Statements
                increment/Decrement
            }   

        -> Do-While Loop

            -> Same as while loop, but runs the code AT LEAST ONCE, before checking the CONDITITON

            -> do {
                   Statements
                } while (condition)
              

        -> NOTE: All loops consists of Initialization, Condition & Increment/Decrement


    -> Take Dynamic Inputs

        -> Scanner: Inbuilt class in util package
            -> util package -> most widely used UTILITIES
            -> Date & Time     
            -> Collections Framework
            -> Random Generator etc

        -> Most widely used Scanner Methods
            -> nextInt(): Reads an integer value.
            -> nextDouble(): Reads a double value.
            -> nextLine(): Reads an entire line of text.
            -> next(): Read the next token (word).
            -> hasNext(): Checks if there is another input available.  

    -> TASK -> Check Attendance Status: (Conditionals)     

    -> TASK Fix below issues 
        -> Why Student name is not being taken (new line is being used as Student Name)
                -> Read new line using nextLine()
        -> Instead of taking a character like (y/n), take the whole word like yes or no YES / NO 
            and ask Student to continue or not
                -> String continueInput = "yes"
                -> while (continueInput.equals("yes") || continueInput.equals("YES") || continueInput.equals("Yes"))

18th June - LOOPS
=================

    -> Classic issues when using Scanner Class Methods

    -> When switching between nextInt() / nextDouble() and nextLine()

    -> new line is represented using \n
